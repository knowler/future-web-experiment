Imagining an HTTP/2-only website without needing to worry about asset bundling.
Playing out some other ideas here like reserved usage of `div`s and `span`s
since they just clutter source code. Instead, using JS-less custom elements
which have semantic meaning for the reader of the code (maybe not the browser or
any accessibility API). Might be a bad idea, but whatever, this is just an
experiment.
